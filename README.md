# QR Code Generator

This repository consist of a QR Code Generator that could generate QR Code of anything.



    About This QR Code Generator:

QR codes are now used in a much broader context, including both commercial tracking applications and convenience-oriented applications aimed at mobile-phone users (termed mobile tagging). QR codes may be used to display text to the user, to open a webpage on the user's device, to add a vCard contact to the user's device, to open a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), to connect to a wireless network, or to compose an email or text message.QR codes have become common in consumer advertising. Typically, a smartphone is used as a QR code scanner, displaying the code and converting it to some useful form (such as a standard URL for a website, thereby obviating the need for a user to type it into a web browser). QR code has become a focus of advertising strategy, since it provides a way to access a brand's website more quickly than by manually entering a URL.



    How this QR Code Generator works:

This QR Code Generator works based on the URL/Phone number/text message (or Anything) that is enter as a input to the requirement, and as a output for the provided input it generates a QR Code for the input.The codes for this project are written in Python using some useful libraries.The further updates on this code will be provided soon which will include AUGEMENTED REALITY which would have QR codes used for systems to determine the positions of objects in 3-dimensional space.
